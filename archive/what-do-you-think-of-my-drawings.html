      The Case Study Exhibition #1 comprised of three elements:
      <br />
      1: Solo show by Daniel Dmyszewicz in our kitchen space, made over the course of  3 month in the space.
      <br />
      2: Talk show  between 3 invited guests, in which their individual impressions of Daniels’ work were discussed. Each guest entered into the exhibition twice with the audience.
      Over the course of the evening the audience became more familiar with the work of Daniel than the guests.
      <br />
      3: Contributions by our members in relation to the work of  Daniel, exhibited in the front space.
